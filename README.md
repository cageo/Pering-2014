Abstract:Here we present a novel computational signal processing 
approach for comparing two signals of equal length and sampling 
rate, suitable for application across widely varying areas within
the geosciences. By performing a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) 
followed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis, a 
graphical depiction of links between periodicities present in the 
two signals is generated via two or three dimensional images. In 
comparison with alternate approaches, e.g., wavelet coherence, 
this technique is simpler to implement and provides far clearer 
visual identification of the inter-series relationships. In 
particular, we report on a MatlabÂ® code which executes this 
technique, and examples are given which demonstrate the program 
application with artificially generated signals of known 
periodicity characteristics as well as with acquired geochemical
and meteorological datasets.
